# igrida_launchers
Collections of script to launch your matlab expreriments on IGRIDA. 

## The Rational
I spend (please read "I waste") hours understanding how to copile matlab code on IGRIDA.
I spend hours annoying my colleagues begging for their help.
Finally I came up with the folliwing python scripts to compile matlab code and run my expreriment on the amazing IGRIDA clusteer.

## Acknowledgment
Not even a single line was possible without the help of _Clement_ and _Chatalic Carnage_.  
Please whish them _Long Days and Pleasent Nights_
